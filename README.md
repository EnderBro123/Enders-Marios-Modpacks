*Welcome to **The Magma Grounds**.*

**Useful Pages**

* Use our Issues section for bug reports and suggestions.
* Use our Projects section for keeping track of issues.
* Use our Discussions tab for chatting and sharing ideas about my projects.

***RULES:***

**Our GitHub:**
* Do not post in the wrong Discussions category.
* Do not post official suggestions in our Issue/Suggestions Tracker. Share your idea in our Discussions tab first, and if it gets a lot of attension, then feel free to post it in our Issue/Sugestions Tracker. You will be asked to agree if you've done so. *Do not lie.*
* Do not open unnecessary and/or random issues.

**While Playing:**
* Do **NOT** modify *any* parts of my modpacks.
* Modified and/or Outdated versions of my modpacks will ***NOT*** be supported.
* Issues caused by Dead/Unsupported mods will ***NOT*** be helped with.

*Asking for any help with any of these will result in an instant ban from our GitHub and Discord. If people are lazy and won't help/keep their projects updated, then I can't do anything about the issues their mod(s) cause, I can't report issues to dead mods anyways.*

**FOR IMPAINTENT PEOPLE:**

If you want any issues that you encounter within my modpacks to be fixed quickly (Rather then me doing so, since I'm a bit slow-ish sometimes (We all have lifes outside of Minecraft)), try figuring out the issue yourself and open a Bug Report explaining what yu did to solve said bug/crash. You can also optionally report the issue/bug to the respective and **Active** mod developer(s) yourself.

Do **not** get mad at me about me saying the word *Lazy*. Some mod developers are quite mean (Sometimes the ones that have dead/unsupported mods) and I have no control over it.
