*Welcome to **The Magma Grounds**.*

**Useful Pages**

* Use our Issues section for bug reports and suggestions.
* Use our Discussions tab for chatting and sharing ideas about my projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***RULES:***

**Our GitHub:**
* Do not post in the wrong Discussions category.
* Do not post official suggestions in our Issue/Suggestions Tracker. Share your idea in our Discussions tab first, and if it gets a lot of attension, then feel free to post it in our Issue/Sugestions Tracker. You will be asked to agree if you've done so. *Do not lie.*
* Do not open unnecessary and/or random issues or do any type of shitposting. It's uneeded and annoying.

**While Playing:**
* Do **NOT** modify any parts of my modpacks.
* Modified and/or Outdated versions of my modpacks will ***NOT*** be supported.
* Issues caused by Dead/Unsupported mods will ***NOT*** be helped with.

* Asking for any help with any of these will result in a ban from our GitHub and Discord, thus no support whatsoever. I can't do anything about the problems that dead mods have.

**FOR IMPAINTENT PEOPLE:**

If for whatever reason your too lazy to wait for any issues that you encounter within my modpacks to be fixed, you can either try to figure out the issue yourself and open a Bug Report explaining what you did to solve said bug/crash or, (Rather then me doing so, since I'm a bit slow-ish sometimes (We all have lives outside of Minecraft)) you can also report the issue/bug to the respective and **Active** mod developer(s) yourself. If they refuse to help, then don't come back here shitposting and wining about it.

**FOR DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO HELP (And are ok with the mean-ish README (Doubt it.):**

* Fix issues caused by dead/unsupported mods
* Help with fixing bugs from mods that are still active
* Help with adding new features and/or implementing suggestions
