A repository used as a bug tracker for Magma's modpacks. Pull Requests are not accepted, and will be ignored/closed.

Do **NOT** modify *any* parts of my modpacks.

* Modified and/or Outdated versions will **NOT** be supported.
* Issues caused by Dead/Unsupported mods will **NOT** be helped with.
* Asking for any help with either of these will result in an instant ban from our repository.

**FOR THE IMPAINTENT PEOPLE:**

If you want any issues that you encounter within my modpacks to be fixed quickly (Rather then me doing so, since I'm a bit slow-ish sometimes (We all have lifes outside of Minecraft)), try figuring out the issue yourself and open a Bug Report explaining what yu did to solve said bug/crash. You can also optionally report the issue/bug to the respective mod developer(s) yourself, however if they're lazy and refuse to help you, then do *not* complain to either of us.
