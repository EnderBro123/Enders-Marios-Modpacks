***The Magma Grounds Modpack License***

Do **NOT** modify *any* parts of my modpacks. Modified versions will **NOT** be supported.
Issues caused by Inactive and/or Unsupported mods will **NOT** be helped with.

**Useful Pages**

* Use our Issues section for bug reports and suggestions.
* Use our Projects section for keeping track of issues.
* Use our Discussions tab for chatting and sharing ideas about my projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Discussions Tab rules/guidelines:**

* Do not post in the wrong category.
* Do not post official suggestions in our Issue/Suggestions Tracker. I want people to chat about each other's suggestions and them to be well-thought out and not be a single sentence long. If you have an idea, share it on our Discussions tab! But, please don't post it on our Issues/Suggestions Tracker unless others agree with you on it.
* Do not post bug reports in the Discussions tab. Our Issues section is here for exactly that.

Failure to follow these rules will result in a warning. Reaching 3 warnings will result in your removal from our repository.
