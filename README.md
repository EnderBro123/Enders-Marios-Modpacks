***The Magma Grounds Modpack License***

Do **NOT** modify any parts of my modpacks. Modified versions will **NOT** be supported.

***SUPPORT POLICY***

All of our modpacks have many mods, but apparently a lot of these mods have developers that won't continue their mods, give support for 1.12 after updating to 1.13, or give their mods to others to keep them alive.

Basically, the developers of these mods won't help anyone. **Do not** ask for help with issues related to dead/unsupported mods. I'm **not** wasting my time with issues that I can't fix. This issue tracker is only meant for simple exploits or issues related to my modpacks. Take other issues to their respective **active and helpful** developers.

Any questions/support/issues related to them posted on to here will result in them being ignored, or your removal from our issue tracker.

Even though I'm strict with exploit and issue reporting, I can still be a kind and loveable slime. Just follow our policy, and your good. No need for a big war to break out.
