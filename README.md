*Welcome to **The Magma Grounds**.*

**Useful Pages**

* Use our Issues section for bug reports and suggestions.
* Use our Discussions tab for chatting and sharing ideas about my projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***RULES:***

**Our GitHub:**
* Do not post in the wrong Discussions category.
* Do not post official suggestions in our Issue/Suggestions Tracker. Share your idea in our Discussions tab first, and if it gets a lot of attension, then feel free to post it in our Issue/Sugestions Tracker. You will be asked to agree if you've done so. *Do not lie.*
* Do not open unnecessary and/or random issues.

**While Playing:**
* Do **NOT** modify any parts of my modpacks.
* Modified and/or Outdated versions of my modpacks will ***NOT*** be supported.
* Issues caused by Dead/Unsupported mods will ***NOT*** be helped with.

* Asking for any help with any of these will result in an instant ban from our GitHub and Discord. If people are lazy or busy and won't help with issues or keep their projects updated, then I can't do anything about the problems their mod(s) cause. Blame them for the bug(s) their mod causes.

**FOR IMPAINTENT PEOPLE:**

If you want any issues that you encounter within my modpacks to be fixed quickly (Rather then me doing so, since I'm a bit slow-ish sometimes (We all have lifes outside of Minecraft)), try figuring out the issue yourself and open a Bug Report explaining what you did to solve said bug/crash. You can also optionally report the issue/bug to the respective and **Active** mod developer(s) yourself.

**FOR DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO HELP (And are ok with the mean-ish README (Doubt it.):**

* Fix issues caused by dead/unsupported mods
* Help with fixing bugs from mods that are still active
* Help with adding new features and/or implementing suggestions
